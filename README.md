## Data Download
### Technical University of Munich:
[First version](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/1459256?show_id=1454690): 

	This version is designed for an Alibaba AI Challenge (https://tianchi.aliyun.com/competition/entrance/231683/introduction)
	Training: 	42 cities around the world
	Validation:	western half of 10 other cities covering 10 cultural zones	

[Second version](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/1459256?show_id=1483140):

	This version completes the first version with the testing data
	Training: 	42 cities around the world
	Validation:	western half of 10 other cities covering 10 cultural zones
	Testing:	eastern half of the 10 other cities	

[Third version](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/1613658):

	This is the "3 splits version" of the So2Sat LCZ42 dataset. It provides three training/testing data split scenarios:
	1. Random split: every city 80% training / 20% testing (randomly sampled)
	2. Block split: every city is split in a geospatial 80%/20%-manner
	3. Cultural 10: 10 cities from different cultural zones are held back for testing purposes

# Description of the content of sen2
Sentinel-2 data bands (the 4th dimension of data):

	1st band: B2
	2nd band: B3
	3rd band: B4
	4th band: B5
